For some reason I never got my head around how to annotate variance in Scala. Basically if B is a subtype of A then:

| | meaning | notation |
|---|:---|---:|
|**covariant**|	means that C[B] is a subtype of C[A]|	C[+A]|
|**contravariant**|	C[A] is a subtype of C[B]|	C[-A]|
|**invariant**|	C[A] and C[B] are not related|	C[A]|

Few resources to read more about that:
