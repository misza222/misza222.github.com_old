Here are my notes from going through [Introduction to Machine Learning course from Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120).
This is intended as a reference for myself, so if you find it useful, it is an added bonus :)

### Naive Bayes

>Bayes’ law describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes’ theorem, a person’s age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age.
