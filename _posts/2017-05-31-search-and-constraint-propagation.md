Search with constraint propagation if one of the fundamental ways to think of a computationally difficult problem. The basic idea is, that if you can't expand all the possibilities of the game, apply constraints (coded rules) to limit the search width and or depth.

As an example of this see [Kakuro AI Agent](https://github.com/misza222/AI-Kakuro) that I've created to show it in practice. Feel free to fork and contribute - there are things to be done there still :)
