My python skills are very rusty. I've used [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/misza222)
to do some "katas". Quite fun, but got a better idea and  created a naive bayes
classifier to detect spam on kaggle sms dataset.
Pure python array and so veeery slow (as forgot quite a bit about pandas and numpy), but works quite well :)

See [github repo](https://github.com/misza222/PythonRefresher) for a jupyter
notebook with a code and some description.
